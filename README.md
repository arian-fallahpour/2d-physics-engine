# 2D Physics Engine

This project is a 2D physics engine designed to simulate the motion and interactions of objects in a 2D environment. It includes realistic physics behaviors such as collision detection, forces, friction, gravity, planetary simulations and more. The engine is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easily extendable for various applications, from simple games to more complex simulations.

## Features
- Rigid Body Dynamics: Simulates realistic object movement with mass, velocity, and acceleration.
- Collision Detection: Detects and resolves collisions between various shapes (circles, rectangles, etc.).
- Forces & Gravity: Applies forces such as gravity and user-defined forces to objects.
- Friction & Damping: Models surface friction and damping to slow down objects.
- Elastic & Inelastic Collisions: Allows for both bouncy and sticky collision behaviors.
- Customizable Properties: Easily configure object properties like mass, friction, and custom modifiers to change behaviour on-the-go

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (for web-based demos)
- Install Node.js

### Installation

You can download the zip and extract the project, or you can use Git by doing the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2d-physics-engine.git
```

### Running the program

Then, run the following command to host a local server on desired port:
```
npm run start:dev
```

### Playing around

Check out the multiple presets that are already available, and edit them as you wish!
